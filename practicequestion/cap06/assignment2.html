                <h1> i tags</h1>
                <p>The <i> tag defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The content inside is typically  displayed in italic.
                    tag is often used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another language, a thought, a ship name, etc.
                     element only when there is not a more appropriate semantic element, such as: </p>
                     <h2> u tags</h2>
                     <p>The U tag represents some text that is unarticulated and styled differently from normal text, 
                        such as misspelled words or proper names in Chinese text. The content inside is typically displayed with an underline.
                         You can change this with CSS </p>
                         <h3> select tag</h3>
                         <p>The select element is used to create a drop-down list.The element is most often used in a form, to collect user input.
                            The name attribute is needed to reference the form data after the form is submitted (if you omit the name attribute,
                             no data from the drop-down list will be submitted).</p>
                        <h4> button</h4>
                       <p>The <button> tag defines a clickable button.element you can put text (and tags like i tags , b tags, strong tags, br tags, img tags, etc.).
                         That is not possible with a button created with the input element!</p>
                        <h5>hr tag</h5>
                        <p>  The hr tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page (e.g. a shift of topic). 
                            element is most often displayed as a horizontal rule that is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page.
